![Completed task demonstration](images/function_demo.gif)

## Usage
Clone the repo, open index.html. Loads jquery from CDN but no other dependencies, so doesn't require a web server. 

## Notes
- Repeat requests are avoided by removing the onclick handler once the promise is resolved successfully. This may not be the best idea in real code, caching could be better.
- Requires ES6 for for...of construct, should be fine in anything that isn't IE according to [browser compatibility list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for...of#Browser_compatibility)

## Testing
I don't have much experience with automated testing, so instead performed some manual tests on the main functionality.

### List repositories from the 'nodejs' organisation by name

The nodejs organisation on Github has 151 repositories.

##### Expected:
```
length: 151
```

##### Actual:
```
length: 30 
```
A quick check shows that the [github API uses pagination](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/traversing-with-pagination/). Since showing all 150 repos in a list is probably a bad idea anyway, I just checked that all 30 repos shown exist in the org.

### When clicking on a repository, expand and make a request to get the open issues from that repository

Manually check open issues for some of the repositories on github against results of my code.

#### http-parser

##### Expected:
```
Is there any parser for mysql like http-parser?
The http request can't be totally parsed
oss-fuzz integration
Consolidate duplicate content-length response headers semver-major
add BINDIR in Makefile
How do you install this package in Ubuntu
[Idea] Rewriting in LLVM DSL
Supporting mildly-broken clients and/or ICE/1.0
Conan package for http-parser
Test "CONNECT_WITH_BODY_REQUEST" maybe worng
Need to consider the noBody situation for HEAD method
Group related tests into files
Convert test suite to TAP output
HTTP/0.9 does not have header fields
Makefile is broken for OS X
http-parser fails to detect chunked encoding at the end of a list
http-parser impossible condition check
http-parser invalid octets allowed in reason-phrase
http-parser allows extra spaces before the status code?
uri-parser allows extra characters after asterisk?
uri-parser incorrect escape of pct-encoded? 
Custom methods should be supported
Making it easier to build it for OpenIndiana
Is this valid according to rfc2616?
Support for digits, -, +, and . in uri scheme
ProTip! Add no:assignee to see everything thatâ€™s not assigned.
CMake support
HEAD, 1xx, 204, 304 have content-length but do not have body
http_parser should invoke the begin message callback on first byte, regardless of whether or not its valid
Forcing a pause at the end of HTTP headers


```
##### Actual:
```
Is there any parser for mysql like http-parser?
The http request can't be totally parsed
Ensure host offset & length are initialized - fuzzer found possible leaks
MSVC Error C2220: p hides prev. local declaration
test: various small fixes
oss-fuzz integration
Consolidate duplicate content-length response headers
Support ICE/1.x for SOURCE requests.
Chunk extensions callbacks
Assign LIBDIR if not already defined
use BINDIR in Makefile
add BINDIR in Makefile
How do you install this package in Ubuntu

Supporting mildly-broken clients and/or ICE/1.0
Conan package for http-parser
Test "CONNECT_WITH_BODY_REQUEST" maybe worng
Need to consider the noBody situation for HEAD method
Group related tests into files
Convert test suite to TAP output
HTTP/0.9 does not have header fields
Makefile is broken for OS X
install `package'
add .deps and .dirstamp to .gitignore
[WIP] CMake Support
Add basic CMake support
ignore headers transfer_encoding_chunked and content_length to work with http assemblers.
Cython bindings -- Interested?
Unbreak `make install` in BSDs
```

remove semicolon :)
```

##### Actual:
```
remove semicolon :)
```

From reading, the github API returns pull requests as well as issues. Paired with pagination, this means the lists won't match up, but looking at both issues and pull requests on the site gives equivalent results.

### Intermediate loading state 

I'm not sure how to test formally for this. I can see it loading. Then it disappears after it has the information. 

### Handle errors while requesting the API by logging to the console

The API works as expected while online. To test if the errors get logged to the console, I ran the function while not connected to the internet. I also expect this to happen if the Github site was down.

##### Expected:
```
Get list of repos failed
```
logged to console.

##### Actual:
```
Get list of repos failed
```
logged to console.

The 'Loading...' also didn't change. 

### Only request issues once per repository

Checked the Network tab under the Inspector (Google Chrome) to see what requests are being made. When each repository is clicked, it doesn't matter how many times it is clicked, the request only runs once for that repository.
